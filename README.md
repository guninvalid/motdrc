# motdrc
A simple configurable MOTD (message of the day) writer.

Setup:
Download .motdrc and source it in your .bashrc file or equivalent. Download bin/random-motd to your /bin/ directory and make it executable. Download etc/motd and etc/random-motd.json to your /etc/ directory and make it readable.

Usage:
You may add or remove lines to random-motd.json as desired according to JSON syntax. Hopefully the code works "out of the box", but I have no confidence that it will because I'm bad at this

Dependencies:
motdrc uses node.js.
